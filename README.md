# DjangoWebProject1

The goal of this project is to record traffic data between two points to analyze the trend based on time. I've noticed strange traffic congestion around noon where I live, so I want to better predict when to leave the house to optimize my time.

I use Django to record and display the data and the TomTom Traffic API to get the traffic data.

TODO:

- [ ] Incorporate TomTom API
- [ ] Automate fetching of traffic data
- [ ] Analyze collected data
- [x] ~~Create Django models and views~~
